    "content": "From my GitHub account getting flagged to winning the 𝘈𝘥𝘰𝘣𝘦 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢 𝘏𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 - what a journey! 🏆11:50 𝐏𝐌, 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧: We uploaded our code for the problem statement, made the submission, and decided to get some sleep after days of hard work and several midnight coding sessions. Then I got the email: \"Your GitHub account has been flagged.\" All that the evaluators had was our GitHub repository for the code. Now the repo was visible to me and no one else. 4 𝐀𝐌, 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞: I queried every public platform and emailed every Adobe mentor, evaluator and HR team about the issue. Fortunately, both my teammates had forked the repository earlier and all the commit history was visible from their repo. All we needed to do was change the GitHub link in the form submitted. The Adobe team was incredibly supportive and active in helping us update our submission.2 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫: WhatsApp notification congratulating us for reaching the finale! And then the plot twist - one night before presenting at Adobe's office, GitHub emails: \"Your account has been recovered. Flagged due to issues on our end.\" 🤯𝐅𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐞: The millisecond delay before the emcee announced \"Team FrYdAy” as winners felt like an eternity. And then came the prizes. When our computers lagged while running the code, we used to joke \"Ab to Mac aane vala hai kucch dino mein\". That became reality when we saw those MacBook M3 boxes! The Adobe Hackathon taught me that AI/ML isn't just complex mathematics - it's robust pipelines, system design, strategic use of pre-trained models. More importantly, I learned to see problems as creative challenges, not roadblocks.Winning a national hackathon and starting my career at Adobe? That's a turning point I never saw coming. hashtag#AdobeHackathon hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AdobeIndia Register now: https://lnkd.in/d3pjkdK7 Raghavendra Abhishek Rao Harpreet KaurShubham Gupta Tanay Falor",
