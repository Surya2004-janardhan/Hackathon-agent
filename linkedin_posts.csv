Our teams were able to cut off the threat before it impacted users. We believe this is a first for AI in cybersecurity, which could go a long way in stopping threats before they become widespread.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re making a long-term bet to help prove and scale it, in the same way weâ€™re doing for nuclear energy from small modular reactors and geothermal. To start, weâ€™re making the largest direct corporate purchase of fusion power from Commonwealth Fusion Systemsâ€™s future plant. Weâ€™re also investing to help them build on promising breakthroughs. For example, their high-temperature superconductor magnets can be used by smaller machines, which are significantly cheaper and faster to build.The path to commercialization wonâ€™t be easy, but we think the upsides could be transformative.

I spent the day with the next generation of technologists, from high schoolers who are starting to explore STEM, to college students embarking on their computer science and technology careers.First stop - the Pittsburgh Google office where I spoke with students who shared STEM projects that theyâ€™re working on, and teachers who are exploring how to bring AI into their classrooms. As part of that, we announced a $25 million fund from Google.org for organizations that are helping educators and students across the US build their AI skills.Over at Carnegie Mellon University, students showed me around the Robotics Institute and the Mission Control Lab, where I got to see a model of Iris, the smallest rover ever to go to space (very cool). While there, I gave a talk about how AI is accelerating scientific discovery and chatted with President Farnam Jahanian and over 2,000 students. Super inspiring and can't wait to come back!","7,934","157 comments",""

Thatâ€™s why last year I was proud to announce our Cybersecurity Clinics Fund, with an initial $20 million to support 20 cybersecurity clinics in higher education institutions across the US. In the same way that law or medical schools offer free community clinics, cybersecurity clinics provide students with opportunities to build career skills while providing an important service to their local communities. So far, 10 of those clinics have received funding and mentorship. In their first semester, more than 450 students have been working with 80 community organizations, including small businesses, fire departments, K-12 schools, and more.Based on the strength and diversity of applications, weâ€™re expanding our commitment to $25M+ and sharing the next 15 clinics to receive funding â€” 25 clinics in total. We've selected schools from across the country with the goal of expanding access to cybersecurity education and services for a wide range of communities. Weâ€™re excited to see this initiative continue to help train the next generation of cybersecurity leaders while keeping communities safe.https://lnkd.in/eJ9NiCtE","3,436","113 comments",""
